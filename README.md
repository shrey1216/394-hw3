This comprehensive analysis involves two parts. First, we explore the relationship between advertising expenses and company sales using an R script. We generate a scatter plot to visualize the data and assess its linearity. The Pearson correlation coefficient and Spearman's ρ are calculated to measure the correlation strength, and we test if the correlation differs significantly from zero. Fitting a least squares regression line, we determine the coefficient of determination and test the significance of the advertising expenses coefficient. Additionally, we examine residuals and make predictions using confidence and prediction intervals. Enhancing the scatter plot, we include the fitted line, confidence bands, and prediction bands. In the second part, we focus on the log returns of Intel and Citigroup stocks. We perform regression analyses with and without an intercept, calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient and Kendall's τ, and test the correlation's significance. Expanding the model to include other stock returns, we present the fitted model explicitly and determine the adjusted coefficient of determination. Model selection using the Akaike information criterion is conducted with bidirectional and forward selection methods to identify the preferred model.
